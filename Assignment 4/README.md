## INDUSTRIAL TALK 2: CREDENCE (TM SUBSIDIARY)
After attending the industrial talk about Credence by Ms Qistina, I am genuinely excited about the significant role that Credence is poised to play in the digital landscape. The unveiling of this new cloud and digital services company reflects TM's commitment to meeting the growing demand for cloud and digital adoption in both the private and public sectors.

To foster increased engagement between the audience, the presenter should consider incorporating more interactive elements. Q&A sessions or polls can be practical tools for gauging audience understanding and interest. By encouraging a dynamic exchange of ideas, the presentation becomes a collaborative experience, allowing the audience to participate in the discussion actively.

I learned a lot from the industrial talk, giving me a new perspective on digital transformation. It's also given me a new sense of direction and purpose in my future career. I can't wait to use the principles and insights from this talk to inform my professional growth and make a difference in the ever-changing world of technology.
