## INDUSTRIAL TALK AND VISIT: UTMDIGITAL

UTM's digital virtual talk provided a comprehensive overview of UTM digital before the actual visit on December 19, 2023. During that time, students were given various perspectives and experiences to explore places such as the most prominent office in UTMDigital, meeting rooms, digital care and even a data centre.

To enhance future digital virtual talk events and visits, they should include more interactive elements, such as Q&A sessions or discussions, to engage the audience actively. Providing specific examples of successful implementations of digital strategies at UTM could make the content more relatable and applicable to real-world scenarios.

Overall, attending UTM's digital virtual talk and visit was a valuable experience that provided deep insights into the university's digital infrastructure and services. The discussion on digital networks, data security, and digital innovation demonstrated UTM's commitment to staying at the forefront of technology. Measures like firewalls and intrusion prevention systems in the data centre showcased UTM's dedication to protecting sensitive information.
