## PC ASSEMBLE (LAB)
In the PC assembly lab and quiz session, students engaged in a hands-on experience of disassembling and reassembling a personal computer. Students gained practical insights into the intricacies of computer hardware, honed their assembly skills, and solidified their understanding through a quiz assessing their theoretical knowledge.

Some of the improvements needed in this session are to provide students with pre-session resources, such as reading materials or online tutorials, to familiarize themselves with PC components before the hands-on lab. This ensures a more prepared and confident participant base.

In conclusion, the PC assembly lab and quiz session have equipped me with practical skills and deepened my skills in teamwork.
